# ECS 150 programming projects

These projects are meant to get you warmed up with programming in the C++/UNIX
environment. None are meant to be particularly hard, but should be enough so
that you can get more comfortable programming. 

Realize the best thing you can do to learn to program in any environment is to
program **a lot**. These small projects are only the beginning of that
journey; you'll have to do more on your own to truly become proficient.

* [Unix Utilities](project1)
* [Unix Shell](project2)
* [Concurrent Web Server](project3)

Tip of the hat to Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau for the amazing
[textbook](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) and
[projects](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects),
which we borrow from heavily.
